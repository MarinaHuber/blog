To start with I would like to stress that English is not my native language and I am by no means a writer, 
so please bear with me as I share few of my thoughts and experience other people struggle with too.  
I got into this thing back at my Uni, at interactive media class. I studied Design under the Architectural university 
and I found that rendering shapes and motion graphics intrigued me more than actual major study.
 With no compiler run time and just generating small websites seemed so much more to learn than actual study at the time. 
 So after study I moved abroad and got an internship at the Digital Design Studio DeMonsters working on flash and animations for AR.

 Apart from my digital obsessions I also did all kinds of odd jobs living in Amsterdam â€¦ The most important decision I made in this period is to learn iOS development inside a BootCamp environment in 3 months period i created accountability and commitment to ObjactiveC and Swift. Here is where i got to meet the world of persistent storage, recursive functions, predicate algorithms and nib files. Fist two years where real hard, and if you are not ready to ASK many, many unanswered questions, prepare for the looong ride ðŸ˜°. This makes me think of how this discipline has several carefully crafted abstractions (legacy shit), one on top of the other. And slowly, we keep peeling apart the layers(onions ðŸŒ½) and learning more and more about how our iOS software actually ticks.
