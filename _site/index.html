        <p>Where to begin! Where to begin‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Localisation is something that occurs in every project I encounter. 
I found that having a list of useful tips that cover most aspect of localisation is nice to have, 
so I created this post as memory of current best and possible new practices.
There is a slight distinction between internationalization and localization:<br />
Internationalization ‚Äî the process of making your app able to adapt to different languages, regions, and cultures.<br />
Localization ‚Äî the process of translating your app into multiple languages.
So, in total it depends on context, and namely on the following established elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>User gender</li>
  <li>Singular and plural in the text</li>
  <li>Platforms: Web, Android, iOS</li>
  <li>Project objective for which the translation is being done.</li>
</ul>

        <p>A
good section of this post is about the research + a project ‚ÄúDiagram‚Äù and steps I wish somebody told me upfront. Before I dive into Auto Layout, should I remind you also of legacy in frames üòù, masks ‚Äî you always had to tell buttons and other controls how big they should be, either by setting their frame or bounds properties or by resizing them in Interface Builder. But it turns out that most controls are perfectly capable of determining how much space they need, based on their ‚Äî content. üåàü¶Ñüåà
üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Note: There is a tool Scherlock ‚Äî it lets you edit views and layout constraints in real time, simulate running on other devices, and jump straight to the source code, all from your iOS Simulator ‚Äî zero configuration required only $$ after trial.</p>

<p>Things I want to accomplish:‚èé
‚Äî Solve errors in layout IB Auto Layout
‚Äî Solve errors in code Auto Layout</p>

        <p>Networking code can definitely be improved. Thanks Apple! No third parties here!
üëå So since Swift 4 we got Codable with Decodable and Encodable protocols that 
provide support for native class (reference type), struct and enum as well (value types) all concrete data types‚Ä¶</p>

<p>First of all Codable is defined as typealias Codable = Decodable &amp; Encodable and we go for two required protocols:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decodable: to parse JSON (get response)</li>
  <li>By decoding the JSONData we will receive/read the data
    <ol>
      <li>Encodable: to generate JSON (post response)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>To convert your codable type into Data.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="people-and-culture">People and Culture</h1>

<h2 id="open-source-by-default">Open Source by Default</h2>

<p>By the end of 2016, almost every major front-end application at Artsy was <a href="http://code.dblock.org/2015/02/09/becoming-open-source-by-default.html">Open Source by Default</a>. This means looking for reasons for something to be closed-source as opposed to reasons to be open. Our entire working process is done in the open, from developer PRs to QA. This post was also written collaboratively and in the open as you can see <a href="https://github.com/artsy/artsy.github.io/pull/325">here</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes it makes sense to keep some details private for competitive reasons. We therefore also create a private GitHub repository for front-end teams that require cross-project issues and team milestones. This is done using <a href="https://www.zenhub.com">ZenHub</a>, and is managed by Engineering leads and Product Managers.</p>

<h2 id="developer-workflow">Developer Workflow</h2>

<p>Most development workflow tries to mimic large open-source project development where most work happens on forks and is pull-requested into an Artsy repository shared by everyone. Typically an engineer will start a project, application or service and is automatically its benevolent dictator. They will add continuous integration and will ask other engineers on the team to code review everything from day one. Others will join and entire teams may take over. Continuous deployment and other operational infrastructure will get setup early.</p>

<p>In some of our newer apps we have switched to PR based deployments via CIs. In this case, on Artsy‚Äôs repository, we would have <em>master</em> and <em>release</em> branches where <em>master</em> is the default branch and all the PRs are made to master. Once a PR is reviewed and merged to <em>master</em> it will automatically get deployed on staging. Production deployment is a pull request from <em>master</em> to a <em>release</em> branch, this way we know what commits are going to be deployed in this release. Once merged, CI will automatically deploy the <em>release</em> branch to production.</p>

<h2 id="slack">Slack</h2>

<p>Originally the engineering team used IRC, but in 2015 we switched to Slack and encouraged its use throughout the whole company. We‚Äôre now averaging about 16,000 Slack messages a day inside Artsy.</p>

<p>Slack usage started out small, but as the Artsy team grew, so did the number of locations where people worked. Encouraging people to move from disparate private conversations in different messaging clients to using slack channels has really made it easier to keep people in the loop. It‚Äôs made it possible to have the serendipitous collaboration you get by overhearing something important nearby physically.</p>

<h2 id="global-engineering">Global Engineering</h2>

<p>While most Engineers live in New York, our Engineering team has contributors in Amsterdam, Berlin, Seattle, Minneapolis, Boston and London. We‚Äôve not shied away from hiring regardless of locations.</p>

<p>To help people know each-other across the company we developed and open-sourced a <a href="https://github.com/artsy/team-navigator">team navigator</a>. We also facilitate weekly meetings between any three people across the company with a tool called <a href="https://github.com/ilyakava/sup">sup</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe worth mentioning that most of the channels shared between developers and other people at artsy(specialists, designers, product people, etc) which encourages collaboration and integration of art+technology as well. Also maybe worth mentioning that we have dedicated help channels per product team and well as company wide help channel.</p>
